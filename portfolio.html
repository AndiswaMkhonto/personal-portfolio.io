    <p>My Bio:</p>
    
       <p>I am a Systems Development Learner for Standard Bank. I have a
         National Diploma in Intelligent Industrial Systems from the Tshwane Univers
         ity of Technology. Currently I am busy with my BTech degree in Computer Systems
         Engineering at the Tshwane University of Technology. I am a very passionate
         aspring Android Engineer. I have done an internsip at Digititan company 
         in Pretoria for nine months where I was helping the Android Development team
         get an app done which was a virtual learning application targeted at upskilling
         for unemployed graduates. We were using Java for coding, Android studio IDE
         and Firebase Realtime Database for storing and saving Data which we could 
         later retrieve.
       </p>
       <p>These are some of the projects I have done as part of my learning:</p><br>

        <li> <a href="https://github.com/AndiswaMkhonto/Googlemaps-with-Geofencing.git">Google maps app with geofencing</a></li>
        <p>What this application does is it tracks a user's current location and uses the geofence feauture to show the user all free wifi hotspot 
        areas which are in a radius of 500m from where the person is.I used java and Android studio</p>
        <li> <a href="https://github.com/AndiswaMkhonto/ScoreKeeperApp.git">Score keeper Application</a></li>
        <p>This is a simple app which tracks the scores of two soccer teams playing against each other and displays score on textview according
        to a button clicked , either a win or foul button which adds scores accordingly.</p>
